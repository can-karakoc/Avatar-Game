## 🚀 Project Description

BYOW is a 2D tile-based world generation and exploration engine project inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender. 🎮 The goal is to create an interactive world where players explore randomly generated environments, collect tokens (elements), and navigate between main and mini-worlds.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Java**: The project is implemented in Java, focusing on software engineering principles rather than complex data structures or algorithms. ☕️

- **StdDraw**: Utilized for basic graphics rendering capabilities, supporting user interaction with keyboard and mouse clicks. 🎨

- **Git**: Version control system used for collaborative development, ensuring code stability and collaboration. 🔄

- **JUnit**: Testing framework for unit testing, ensuring code functionality and correctness. ✅

## 🔄 Project Phases

### Phase 1: World Generation

- Implemented a pseudo-randomly generated 2D grid of tiles using the BYOW tile engine.
- Created distinct rooms and hallways, supporting various room shapes and hallway intersections.
- Ensured connectivity between rooms and hallways, preventing gaps in the floor.
- Developed a world generator capable of creating visually distinct and unique layouts.

### Phase 2: Interactivity

- Added player control with avatar movement using W, A, S, and D keys.
- Implemented deterministic behavior, ensuring the same sequence of key presses results in the same outcome. ⚙️
- Introduced a Heads Up Display (HUD) for user interface, displaying information about the tile under the mouse pointer.
- Provided the ability to save and load the world state, allowing users to resume exploration.

## ▶️ How to Run

To experience the project, run the `Main` class with appropriate command-line arguments. Players can explore the world using keyboard controls, navigate between worlds, and interact with the environment.

## 🏆 Achievements and Considerations

- Successfully managed the complexity of building a large system, emphasizing software engineering principles.
- Implemented a world generation algorithm capable of creating diverse and visually appealing layouts.
- Achieved deterministic behavior, ensuring consistent outcomes for the same seed and key presses.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Explore additional game mechanics to enhance user engagement.
- Enhance the user interface for a more immersive experience.
- Optimize and refactor code for better maintainability and extensibility.
